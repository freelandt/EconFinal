##Abstract

Things matter

##Introduction

This is a paper

##Background



###Theory

Countries that are more "well-off" will probably live longer. 

###Previous Work

 Since Auster, Leveson, and Sarachek, several economic studies have attempted to answer these
 questions using data from the United States or multiple countries.1 Many of these have used aggregate
 data from the member countries of the OECD to explain cross-country mortality rates or life
 expectancies.2 While the empirical results are mixed, the general consensus is that population life
 expectancy (or mortality) is a function of environmental measures (e.g., wealth, education, safety
 regulation, infrastructure), lifestyle measures (e.g., tobacco or alcohol consumption), and health care
 consumption measures (e.g., medical or pharmaceutical expenditures). However, the appropriate
 econometric methodology for disentangling these effects and its meaning for the relative importance
 (statistical or economic) of the estimated effects is more contentious.

Referencing a paper from Peltzman in 1987, hard to find, will find later
Peltzman also considered a GLS regression of life expectancy at birth on wealth and government health expenditures and found only wealth to be a significant determinant. His life expectancy variable was an average for the entire
 population (including males and females) of each country and was only for a single age stratum (at
 birth) in each country. 


##Methods

Give a how the data was collected --
what the data is and what is in the data -
Describing the variables - Need to know if we have any other important variables to look at before we can continue.

The data we used was assembled from smaller datasets that were gotten from Gapminder World. The data from gapminder was provided by the World Bank, World Health Organization and Gapminder themselves. We combined these smaller data sets to give us a data set containing all of the variables that we were intested in examining. Our data has various country level information taken between the years 19XX and 20XX. Each observation in our data set was a specific country in a specific year and all of the corresponding country level information, like population or gdp per capita, for that country in that year. Overall our data contains X complete observations with Y variables per observation. 

For a full overview of each individual variable in our data set, see description below:

##Results

Start this sections with data visualization. Then move on to say final model and give summary of model, then interpretations. 

##Discusion

###Robustness

This is where we can talk about any heteroscedasticity we found, which I am sure we will have, we will also probably have some sort of geographical relationship for our residuals which we just won't be correcting for, but could with random effects. 

###Limitations and Future Work

With this type of study we must make it clear that we are looking at association and not causation. Our results do not indicate that by increasing X we cause an increase in average life expectancy in a country. Another limitation is that we could be missing explanatory variables in our initial model and so some of the associations that we found may be significant because we are missing other explanatory variables. If we had more time we would have liked to found more observations that contained some other variable that were mentioned in some of the papers like (INSERT SOME VARIABLE THAT WE DIDN'T FIND). It also would have been interesting to look at the possible different factors that are significant in different geographical areas of the world. For example fitting a model for average life expectancy in North America and fitting a model for life expectancy in Africa and then comparing what variables were significant in either model and trying to figure out why some things may have been significant in one model and not the other. 

In the future it would be interesting to also look at this model with a heirarchichal linear regression model, and seeing if after accounting for differences between country and continent if some of the variables we deemed significant in our model would still be significant, and looking at the changes in effect after adding all of the random effects.
